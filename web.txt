How does the internet work?
    The internet is really just an enourmous network. A combination of computers and server computers everywhere that work 
    together with other more designated computers to allow communication and store information between all. Computers are 
    grouped on local networks either wirelessly or wired to a router which uses a modem to connect to an Internet Service 
    Provider, which then connects you to other ISPs, modems, routers and computers all over the world. pretty cool.

What happens when you click a link?
    In not too many words, Your browser takes the link that you clicked and takes the domain name from that link and uses a 
    DNS or Domain name System to locate the IP address for the site. This is all returned to your browser which gives the 
    browser a pathway to access the site you are attempting to reach.
